# The AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryReadOnly policy is necessary because EKS worker nodes need to pull container images from Amazon ECR (Elastic Container Registry), especially for:
#     Core system components (like the VPC CNI plugin, CoreDNS, kube-proxy)
#     Add-ons (like the EBS CSI driver)
#     Your own application images â€” if you build and push them to ECR
